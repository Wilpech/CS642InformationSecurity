The key exploit here is a buffer overflow attack. I chose to go about doing this by exploiting the strcpy function. There is never a point where this input is checked or even capped for that matter so all I needed to do was create a buffer of the same size as our target and fill it with NOPs. From there I just added in the shellcode code at the very end of our buffer, and a pointer back into the buffer so that nothing executes until we hit the cheeky shellcode command. The root shell should pop up from there.
